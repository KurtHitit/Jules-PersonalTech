# Screens

This directory contains the top-level screen components for the mobile application. Each file typically represents a full screen or a major view within the app.

Examples:
- `HomeScreen.tsx`
- `AddItemScreen.tsx`
- `ItemDetailScreen.tsx`
- `SettingsScreen.tsx`
- `LoginScreen.tsx`

Screens are usually composed of smaller, reusable components found in `src/components/`. They manage their own state or use global state management solutions and handle navigation logic.
