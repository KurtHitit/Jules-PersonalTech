# Navigation

This directory is for setting up and configuring navigation within the React Native app.
It will typically involve using a library like React Navigation.

Files might include:
- `AppNavigator.tsx`: The main navigator that combines different stacks or tabs.
- `AuthStack.tsx`: Navigation stack for authentication screens (Login, SignUp).
- `MainStack.tsx` or `HomeTabs.tsx`: Navigation for the main part of the app after login.
- `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions for navigation parameters and screen names.
