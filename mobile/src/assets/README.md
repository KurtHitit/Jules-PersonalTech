# Assets

This directory is for static assets used by the mobile application.

Subdirectories:
- `images/`: For image files (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.).
- `fonts/`: For custom font files (TTF, OTF, etc.).
- `data/`: For any static JSON data or mock data used during development.

Ensure that assets are correctly linked or imported in your React Native project (e.g., by configuring `react-native.config.js` for fonts if needed).
