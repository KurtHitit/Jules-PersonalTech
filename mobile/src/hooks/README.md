# Hooks

This directory is for custom React hooks used within the mobile application.
Custom hooks allow for reusing stateful logic across multiple components.

Examples:
- `useAuth.ts`: A hook to manage authentication state and provide auth functions.
- `useFormInput.ts`: A hook to manage form input state and validation.
- `useItems.ts`: A hook to fetch and manage a list of items.
- `usePermissions.ts`: A hook to handle requesting and checking device permissions (e.g., camera, location).
