# Components

This directory is for reusable React Native components used throughout the application.

Subdirectories:
- `ui/`: This subfolder is specifically designated for components added via the `shadcn/ui` CLI. Do not manually create components here; use the CLI (e.g., `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button`).
- Other common components can be placed directly in `components/` or organized into feature-specific subfolders if needed.

Example common components:
- `CustomButton.tsx`
- `ListItem.tsx`
- `Header.tsx`
