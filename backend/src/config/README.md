# Configuration

This directory is for configuration files. This might include:
- Database connection settings
- Environment variable definitions (e.g., using a library like `dotenv`)
- API keys (should be managed securely, often through environment variables)
- Other application-level settings.

Example: `database.ts`, `environment.ts`
