# Tests

This directory contains all automated tests for the backend.
This can include:
- Unit tests (testing individual functions or modules)
- Integration tests (testing interactions between different parts of the application)
- End-to-end tests (less common to be solely here, but possible)

Consider using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Subdirectories might be created for different types of tests (e.g., `unit/`, `integration/`).
